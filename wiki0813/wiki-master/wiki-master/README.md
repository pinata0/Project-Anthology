**INACTIVE NOTICE: This plugin is unsupported by WPMUDEV, we've published it here for those technical types who might want to fork and maintain it for their needs.**

Collaborate, discuss, crowdsource and create better content with Wiki Pro for WordPress, Multisite and BuddyPress.

## Add front-end content collaboration and editing to WordPress with Wiki Pro. Crowdsource everything from fact sheets and instruction manuals to creative writing projects.

Wiki Pro makes it easy to create everything from a collection of member-managed usage documents to a fandom site for your favorite tv show to gather and discuss information about characters, locations, directors and episodes. What better way to engage your users than to allow them to contribute in a meaningful way?

### Activate and Go

**Wiki Pro works out-of-the-box with WordPress, Multisite and BuddyPress and adjusts to fit almost any theme.**

**7 Built-in Widgets** Use built-in widgets to show wiki pages, popular wikis, new wikis, wiki search, wiki categories, wiki tags or a wiki tag cloud in any widget area.

**Control User Access** Limit editing capabilities by user role out-of-the-box, or even by membership level when paired with Membership 2 Pro.

**Custom Titles** Give your wikis and sub wikis a custom name like “Community Fact Sheet,” “Usage Docs” or “Fan Fact Curation.” Make them yours.

**Configure Display Order** Display wiki archives in ascending or descending order by title, order created, title, or randomly – whatever best fits your needs.

The full front end interface makes it easy for any user to collaborate.

### Front-End Control… Like a Wiki Should Be

Wiki Pro adds a simple front-end interface that makes it incredibly easy to use. Create, edit, review or join the conversation, all from the front-end of your site.

Manage and track changes like a WordPress SuperHero from the history tab with revision comparisons and one-click restore – just in case.

### Better Search Results

Quickly sort through hundreds of posts, updates and discussions. Wiki Pro uses wiki specific tags and categories to make content easier to find. Dashboard manager and custom post types give administrators quick access from the backend.

Discussion boards offer clean lines of communication.

### Discussion Boards

Topic-specific discussion boards give users more ways to interact. It’s like a cloud document for post creation, with commenting, collaborative writing and versioning. Make clarifications, ask questions, collaborate on research or share a new perspective.

### Pro Sites and Premium Plugin Integration
